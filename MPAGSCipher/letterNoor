Dear Noor,

Thank you for your e-mail.

Although Andrea and I maintain that you have evicted us illegally, we are not asking for entry to the house.  We are asking you to arrange a time, convenient to Hamid, when we could collect our remaining items at the doorstep. 
I am telling you explicitly now that we do want these items.  If you discard them, we will expect you to pay for their replacement.
However, if you mantain that it is impossible for us to collect the items from Hamid directly, you may send them to us, with the understanding that there is to be no cost to us related to this matter.

If you agree with this and wish to proceed, you may use the following as our forwarding address:

Maria Brigida Brunetti
School of Physics and Astronomy
University of Birmingham
Birmingham B15 2TT
United Kingdom

I'm happy for you to deal with other issues later.  Please ensure, though, that you do this within seven days (i.e. by 11th November), as requested in my previous e-mail.

Regards,
Maria Brigida.
